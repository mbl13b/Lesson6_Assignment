Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

  a) The first method is the appendChild(): to use this method you specify the node to be attached (the child node)
     and the node to attach it to (the parent node). A node attached with this mthod is always added as the last 
     child element of the parent element. 
     
     parentNode.appendChild(childNode)
     
  b) The second method is the cloneNode(): you use this method of the document object to duplicate an existing node.
     This method indicates whether the cloned node should include any child nodes of the existing node (true) or only
     the specified parent node (false). 
       
     existingNode.cloneNode(true | false)
